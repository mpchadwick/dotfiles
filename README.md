## Setting up iTerm2

Thanks to a [great blog post][blog-post] by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm2.
1. Select iTerm2 > Preferences.
1. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
1. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
1. Restart iTerm2.
